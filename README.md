# TSP
The implementations of TSP algorithm

# How to use
  The project consists of 2 implementations of Travelling Salesman Problem. One works via dynamic programming (presented in the reading assignment) and the second one works via Dijkstra approach (presented in the lectures).
  Dynamic programming approach is located in TSP_dp.cpp file and in order to run it you should comment the rest of the files (minheap.h and TSP_dij.cpp).
  Dijkstra approach is split into 2 parts. First part is the implementation of minheap (minheap.h) and the second part is the actual algorithm (TSP_dij.cpp). You need to comment TSP_dp.cpp in order to run this algorithm.
